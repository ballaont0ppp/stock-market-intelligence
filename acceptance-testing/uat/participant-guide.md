### Examples of Think-Aloud

**Good Examples**:
- "I'm looking for a way to buy stock..."
- "I expect this button to take me to my portfolio..."
- "I'm confused about what this number means..."
- "This is taking longer than I expected..."
- "Oh, I see! That makes sense now..."

**What to Share**:
- What you're trying to do
- What you're looking for
- What you expect to happen
- What confuses you
- What surprises you
- What frustrates you
- What delights you

### Tips for Think-Aloud

✅ **Do**:
- Speak continuously
- Share first impressions
- Voice confusion immediately

- Describe what you see

❌ **Don't**:
- Stay silent
- Censor yourself
- Try to be "right"
