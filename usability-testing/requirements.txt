# Usability Testing Framework Requirements

# Core dependencies (should already be installed with main app)
# These are listed for reference only

# Data analysis and reporting
pandas>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0

# No additional dependencies required
# The framework uses only Python standard library for data collection

# Optional: For advanced analysis
# matplotlib>=3.7.0  # For generating charts
# seaborn>=0.12.0    # For statistical visualizations

# Note: The main application dependencies (Flask, SQLAlchemy, etc.)
# should already be installed. This framework only requires Python 3.8+
# and the standard library for basic functionality.
