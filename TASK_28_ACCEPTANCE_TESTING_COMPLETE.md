## Important Notes

### Framework vs. Execution

**What Has Been Completed:**
- ✅ Complete acceptance testing framework
- ✅ All test scenarios and procedures documented
- ✅ All templates and forms prepared
- ✅ Execution guides created
- ✅ Success criteria defined

**What Requires Human Participation:**
- ⏳ Actual UAT sessions with end users
- ⏳ Actual BAT validation with business stakeholders
- ⏳ Actual OAT testing with operations team
- ⏳ Issue resolution and re-testing
- ⏳ Formal sign-offs from all parties

### Why This Approach

Acceptance testing is fundamentally a human-driven process that requires:
- Real end users providing authentic feedback
- Business stakeholders validating business value
- Operations teams confirming operational readiness
- Subjective assessments of usability and satisfaction
- Formal approvals from decision-makers

The framework provides everything needed to conduct thorough acceptance testing, but the actual testing must be performed by the appropriate human participants.
